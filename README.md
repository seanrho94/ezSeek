This is a job searching website which provides an interface for job seekers to quickly skim through jobs and apply for those they are interested in. Employers can then look through all those that applied for their listing and begin invite users to initiate in communication.

Implemented by using HTML/CSS/JavaScript/Django and AWS S3.
